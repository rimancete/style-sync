- [ ] Add loading states and error boundaries
- [ ] URL parsing logic to extract customer slug

##### Step 2.4.7: Dynamic Branding Application

- [ ] Update document title based on customer config
- [ ] Apply CSS variables for theme colors
- [ ] Dynamic logo loading and display
- [ ] Fallback handling for missing assets

##### Step 2.4.8: Customer URL Integration

- [ ] URL change detection and customer context updates
- [ ] Default customer fallback for missing URL slugs
- [ ] Route protection based on customer context

##### Step 2.4.9: Frontend Testing & Validation

- [ ] Unit tests for customer context logic
- [ ] Integration tests for branding application
- [ ] E2E tests for customer identification flow

##### Key Technical Considerations

- URL Structure: `https://solutiondomain.com/{customer-url-slug}/`
- Customer URL slug: lowercase, hyphens, alphanumeric only (max 50 chars)
- Backend-first approach ensures API stability before frontend integration
